# frxnls-ai-stack

Miguel's personal Claude Code stack — skills and agents published under the
`frxnls:` namespace via a local plugin marketplace.

## Layout

## Components

| Type  | Name                | Invoke                     | What it does |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Skill | `qa`                | `/frxnls:qa`               | Test a running web app in a real browser, then fix and verify bugs |
| Skill | `first-principles-brainstorm` | `/frxnls:first-principles-brainstorm` | Adversarial Socratic interviewer — stress-tests an idea, kills complexity, ends with one concrete action |
| Skill | `security-audit` | `/frxnls:security-audit` | Whole-system "CSO" security audit (repo, git history, deps, CI/CD, infra, LLM, skills) — read-only findings report |
| Agent | `rex-code-reviewer` | `frxnls:rex-code-reviewer` | Multi-reviewer PR review (simplicity, security, docs, contracts) — quote-the-line gate, LLM-security lens, hybrid inline comments + summary with severity badges |

## Install

This repo *is* the marketplace, served from GitHub. On any machine:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add FrictionlessTech/frxnls-ai-stack --scope user
claude plugin install frxnls@frxnls --scope user
```

(Repo is private — requires `gh`/git auth with access to the org.)

## Editing components

The live source is the GitHub repo, not your local checkout. To ship a change:

```bash
# edit a skill/agent file, BUMP the version in frxnls/.claude-plugin/plugin.json, then:
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push

# pull the pushed change into Claude Code:
claude plugin marketplace update frxnls
claude plugin update frxnls@frxnls   # qualified name required; plain `frxnls` errors
```

(Restart Claude Code to load updated components.)

> `plugin update` only pulls when the manifest `version` changed — always bump it.
> To force a refresh without a bump: `claude plugin uninstall frxnls && claude plugin install frxnls@frxnls --scope user`.

## Adding a component

- New skill: `frxnls/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- New agent: `frxnls/agents/<name>.md`

Commit, push, then `marketplace update` + `plugin update` as above.

## CI: Rex as a PR-gating bot

`examples/rex-review.yml` is a reference workflow that runs `frxnls:rex-code-reviewer`
on every PR under a **bot identity**, so it can post a real review (GitHub blocks you
from formally reviewing your own PR). Copy it to `.github/workflows/` in the repo you
want reviewed.

**Why a bot:** a review's identity = the token's owner. Run rex under your own token
and GitHub returns 422 on `APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES`. A GitHub App (or the built-in
`github-actions[bot]`) is a different actor, so the review is allowed.

**Don't gate on the review state** — gate on the **job exit code** as a required status
check. The workflow writes `VERDICT=...` and exits non-zero on `REQUEST_CHANGES`; mark
that job required in branch protection to block merges.

**Setup:**
1. Create a GitHub App (perms: Pull requests RW, Contents RO). Install it on the org +
   repos that run the workflow. Store `REX_APP_ID` + `REX_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as secrets.
2. Copy `examples/rex-review.yml` into the target repo.
3. Branch protection on the default branch → require the `rex` check.

**Forked PRs:** fork PRs get a read-only token and no secrets. Running rex on untrusted
fork code with secrets needs `pull_request_target` (injection risk). Fine for private
org repos (internal PRs only); for public repos, gate forks behind a label or manual
dispatch.

### Cross-org access (App owned in one org, repo in another)

**This repo is public**, so installing the plugin in CI needs no token — the cross-org
read concern below is moot. The notes remain for reference (and if it ever goes private).

A GitHub App's **owner** and its **install location** are independent. You do not "share"
an App across orgs — you **install** it on each org where you have admin rights,
regardless of which org owns it. So a Rex App registered under **Forked Up** can be
installed onto **FrictionlessTech** and granted access to its repos.

Two access needs, don't conflate them:
- **Posting the review** — the App is installed on the repo *running the workflow*; its
  token posts there. Same-org, no cross-org issue.
- **Reading `frxnls-ai-stack`** (to `plugin install` it) — only a concern if the repo is
  private. Since it's public now, no token is required. If you later make it private:
  1. **Install the Rex App on FrictionlessTech too**, select `frxnls-ai-stack`, and mint a
     token scoped to *that* installation (`actions/create-github-app-token` with
     `owner: FrictionlessTech`, `repositories: frxnls-ai-stack`). A token is per-installation —
     one token can't span both orgs, so you mint a second one for the read.
  2. Or **vendor** the agent file into the reviewed repo
     (`.claude/agents/rex-code-reviewer.md`, the alternative in the workflow).

Org owners installing an App bypass the org's third-party-app access policy, so no extra
allowlisting is needed when you admin both orgs.
